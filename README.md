# Careerology

We would like you to implement a simple careers site with Ruby on Rails.  The careers site should have several sections:

* A page that contains a job description with links to an application form
* An application form that a candidate can fill in and attach a resume and cover letter
  * Application form should contain at least name, email address, phone number
  * Take a look at our careers site for an example - http://www.hireology.com/careers
* An administration site that can edit job descriptions, and view application forms that have been submitted

A few hints:

We believe in good architectural principles and care about making code that is concise, understandable, and something that will last.

Hireology engineers test their code.  We believe in delivering quality features and being able to move quickly with confidence.  Tests and leveraging automated test suites help us accomplish that.

Hireology <3 open source!  We are strong believers in open source software and leverage the great tools that are out there and contributing back to the community when we can.  We leverage a number of different open source tools for our projects and would expect engineers to be always looking for ways to take advantage of what the community has to offer.

And finally, this isn’t a UX/UI project.  While we appreciate beautiful and well thought-out user interfaces and designs (and our extremely kick butt UX team), this isn’t that type of project.  Engineer graphics and helpers like bootstrap are perfectly acceptable for this exercise.  We want to focus on the full stack and not just the user interface.

Logistics:

Please compile this into a project that can be shared via a github repository (public or private is fine).

The repository should include any instructions on how to set up and run the project, any tests, etc.  Remember, if we can’t run your code, it will very difficult for us to evaluate it completely.  Don’t forget to list any 3rd party dependencies (with versions and instructions for use), and bonus points for including scripts to help automate the setup and running of your project.

Ideally, we could clone this project, run through your instructions/scripts and then be able to run your project and evaluate it.

Please complete this exercise within the next 7 days. If you have any questions/concerns or need additional time to complete, please let me know.  We look forward to seeing your submission.
